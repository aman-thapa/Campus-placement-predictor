# Campus Placement Predictor App

Often, there is this uncertainty among students about placements. What if there is a way to know your chances of getting placed? This will not only give the students a heads up but will also motivate them to work harder and seek help from teachers and others in time.

In this project, we consider a placement dataset and try to predict whether a candidate will be placed or not based on his/her past records with the help of Machine Learning.

## Problem Statement
  1. To do a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data and find out factors that affect and do nor affect in the process of placements.
  2. To build ML models that will correctly classify whether a student is placed or not, compare them and find the best model for the classification.
